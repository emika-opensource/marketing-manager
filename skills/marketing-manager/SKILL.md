## ICP & Audience Building

### Creating Buyer Personas

- **Psychographics:** interests, pain points, goals, values
- **Behavioral:** buying behavior, preferred channels, content preferences
- **Size:** estimated addressable market
- **Priority:** primary / secondary / tertiary

### Channel-Audience Matching
Map each audience to the channels where they're most reachable. Consider:
- B2B audiences → LinkedIn, Google Search, email

- Awareness → Social, Display, Influencer, YouTube

**API:**

PUT /api/audiences/:id — Update segment
DELETE /api/audiences/:id — Delete segment
```

## Ad Platform Expertise

### Google Ads

- **Match types:** Broad (widest reach), Phrase (moderate), Exact (precise)
- **Quality Score:** Relevance (ad + keyword + landing page). Aim for 7+
- **Bidding:** Manual CPC for control, Target CPA/ROAS for automation (need 30+ conversions/month)
- **Conversion tracking:** Install gtag.js, set up conversion actions, link GA4

### Meta Ads

POST /api/ad-accounts — Add account { platform, accountId, status, config }
GET /api/ad-accounts/guides — Detailed setup guides for each platform
GET /api/campaigns — List campaigns
POST /api/campaigns — Create campaign { name, platform, type, budget, status, targeting, metrics }
PUT /api/campaigns/:id — Update campaign
```

## Influencer Marketing

### Discovery
- Search by platform, category, follower range, engagement rate
- Check competitor collaborations for ideas
- Use hashtag research to find niche creators
- Look at industry events, podcasts, and thought leaders

### Scoring Methodology
Calculate a score (1-100) based on:
- **Followers (20%):** Reach potential. 1M+ = 90, 100K+ = 70, 10K+ = 50
- **Engagement Rate (30%):** Quality of audience. Rate × 20, capped at 100
- **Relevance (25%):** Category/tag overlap with brand industry and values
- **Price/Value (15%):** Cost per follower ratio. <$0.01/follower = 90, <$0.05 = 60
- **Audience Quality (10%):** Default 50 without API data

Green (>70): Strong match, pursue actively
Yellow (40-70): Potential, investigate further
Red (<40): Low priority

### Outreach Templates

**Professional:**
"Hi [Name], I'm [role] at [Brand]. We've been following your content on [topic] and love your approach to [specific example]. We think there's a great opportunity to collaborate on [campaign idea]. Would you be open to discussing a potential partnership?"

**Casual:**
"Hey [Name]! Big fan of your [platform] content, especially [specific post/video]. We're working on something at [Brand] that I think your audience would love. Want to chat about it?"

**Value-First:**
"Hi [Name], I wanted to share something your audience might find valuable — [offer/insight]. We're [Brand] and we work in [industry]. If this resonates, I'd love to explore a collaboration where we can create something great together."

### Negotiation & Fair Pricing
General rate benchmarks:
- **Nano (1K-10K):** $50-250 per post
- **Micro (10K-50K):** $250-1,000 per post
- **Mid (50K-500K):** $1,000-5,000 per post
- **Macro (500K-1M):** $5,000-20,000 per post
- **Mega (1M+):** $20,000+ per post

### Contract Essentials
Always clarify: deliverables, timeline, usage rights, exclusivity period, revision rounds, payment terms, performance guarantees (if any)

### Performance Measurement
- **EMV (Earned Media Value):** Engagement × industry CPE benchmark
- **CPE (Cost Per Engagement):** Total cost / total engagements
- **ROAS:** Revenue attributed / cost of partnership

### Human-in-the-Loop (CRITICAL)
**ALWAYS** escalate to the user before committing to any deal:
"I found an influencer that looks like a great fit:
- **Name:** [name] (@[handle])
- **Platform:** [platform] | **Followers:** [count] | **Engagement:** [rate]%
- **Score:** [score]/100
- **Asking:** $[price] for [deliverables]
- **Why they fit:** [relevance to brand]

Should I proceed with the outreach/negotiation?"

→ Never commit budget without explicit user approval.

**API:**
```
GET /api/influencers — List all influencers
POST /api/influencers — Add influencer
POST /api/influencers/:id/score — Calculate score
GET /api/influencer-campaigns — List partnerships

### A/B Testing
Generate 2-3 variations per concept:

**API:**
```
POST /api/creatives/generate — Start generation { prompt, type, style, dimensions, platform }
GET /api/creatives/:id/status — Check if ready

```

## Budget Management

### Allocation Strategy
1. Calculate total monthly/quarterly/yearly budget
2. Allocate to channels based on historical ROI and goals
3. Reserve 10-20% for testing and opportunities
4. Track spend vs budget per channel weekly
5. Reallocate from underperforming to overperforming channels monthly

### ROI Calculation
ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost × 100

### When to Adjust
- **Increase:** Channel ROI > 300%, not at diminishing returns
- **Decrease:** Channel ROI < 100% after 2+ weeks of optimization
- **Pause:** Channel ROI < 50% consistently
- **Test:** New channel with 5-10% of budget for 2-4 weeks

**API:**
```
GET /api/budget — Current budget { total, allocated, spent, remaining, period }
PUT /api/budget — Update budget
GET /api/analytics — Full overview with all metrics
```

## What's Real vs Simulated

**Real/Functional:**
- Brand profile CRUD, audience segments, campaign data entry, influencer management + scoring
- Creative generation via fal.ai (requires FAL_KEY)
- Budget tracking, channel management, analytics aggregation
- Deal management with human-in-the-loop approval

**Reference/Tracking Only (no live API integration):**
- Ad account "connections" — stores account IDs for reference, no OAuth or real platform connection
- Campaign metrics — manually entered, not pulled from ad platforms
- Channel performance data — manually entered
- Influencer search — returns guidance suggestions, not real search results

**Not implemented:**
- Notifications, file uploads (multer configured but unused), multi-user auth, data import/export

**Important:** Do NOT tell users their ad accounts are "connected" or "syncing." They are reference entries only. Be transparent about this.

## Proactive Opportunities
Regularly suggest:
- Seasonal campaigns (holidays, industry events)
- Trending topics relevant to the brand
- Competitor gaps or weaknesses to exploit
- New influencers gaining traction in the niche
- Underperforming channels that need attention
- Budget reallocation opportunities
- Creative refresh when ads show fatigue

## Settings
```
GET /api/config — Get config (API keys masked)
PUT /api/config — Update config { falKey, notifications }
```
